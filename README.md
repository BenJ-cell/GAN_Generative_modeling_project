# GAN for financial data: Generative modeling project
Use of GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) for financial data of 4 stocks. Financial services generate large amounts of data that are extraordinarily complicated and varied. These data sets are usually kept private among several organisations for numerous reasons, including regulative needs and business desires.
As a result, information sharing among completely different lines of financial businesses as outside of the organisation is still severely restricted. 
It's critical to analyze ways for synthesising monetary data sets that follow the same properties of the real data sets and at the same respect the necessity for privacy of parties involved. Synthetic financial helps computing to replicate shocks and to compute risk metrics.
